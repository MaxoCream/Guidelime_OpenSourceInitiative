Open Source Guide For World Of Warcraft: Classic By The Community!


The objective of this repo is to create a complete open source guide for WOW: Classic using the addon Guidelime.
Currently, most guides are maintained by one contributor. 
Due to time constrants this exposes them to deprecation and expandability issues.

**So what if the community made and maintained it's own guide?**
Thanks to the developers of Guidelime writing guides is easy and will likely get even easier with updates.
If you haven't already I suggest you go to the [Guidelime wiki](https://github.com/max-ri/Guidelime/wiki) and read what is their.

The hope behind this project is to ensure a detailed guide of the game will always remain available to players.
Ontop of this, updates and additional content may always be covered.
I encourage everyone to contribute as much as possible. Happy grinding!
